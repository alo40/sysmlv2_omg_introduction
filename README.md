# sysmlv2_omg_introduction
Hi, I have decided to start a new repository for sysmlv2 as I would like to try the example given by the omg in the document:

Introduction to the SysML v2 Language
Textual Notation

My previous repo is getting to big and disorganized to make a proper in-deep analysis of the different sintaxis of the language.

As always, wish me luck!
